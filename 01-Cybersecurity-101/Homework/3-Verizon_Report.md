# Security 101 Homework: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape 
## Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report
### In this part, use the *Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report* plus independent research to answer the below questions.
#### 1. What is the difference between an incident and a breach?
``` 
An incident is a security event where confidentiality, integrity and availability is compromised. 
Whereas a breach is a confirmed data exposure by an unauthorized party.
```
#### 2. What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors? 
```
Breaches perpetrated by outside actors stood at around 80 percent, with internal actors 
at around 20 percent.
```
#### 3. What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized crime? 
```
Organized crime was responsible by 80 percent of breaches.
```
#### 4. What percentage of breaches were financially motivated? 
```
The majority of breaches were financially motivated, at over 90 percent.
```
#### 5. Define the following (Additional research may be required outside of the report): 
```
Denial of Service: 
The purpose of a DoS attack is to flood with traffic or by sending/requesting information. 
Some examples include, buffer over flood, ICMP and SYN attacks. The end results includes, 
slow server/services response to complete server/service crash.
```
```
Command and Control: 
C2 is accomplished by infecting a workstation sitting behind a firewall. Usually a hacker infects 
the workstation through phishing campaigns, browser plugins, etc.— once a hacker has 
control of the machine, they can download and execute malicious code. The machine can for example 
become part of a botnet.
```
```
Backdoor:
A back door allows access to a device that bypasses the usual safeguards and/or knowledge of the 
victim. I can be used sometimes for legitimate reasons, but more often than not is used as an 
exploit by threat actors.
```
```
Keylogger: 
A keylogger is a program that records a user’s keystrokes and sends that information to a hacker. 
It’s primarily used to gather credentials and other confidential information.
```
#### 6. What remains one of the most sought-after data types for hackers? 
```
Credentials are the most sought-after data for hackers.
```
#### 7. What was the percentage of breaches involving phishing?
```
Phishing accounts for 36 percent of breaches. A major increase due to the pandemic.
