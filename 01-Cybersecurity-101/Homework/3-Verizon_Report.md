# Security 101 Homework: Cybersecurity Threat Landscape 
## Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report
### In this part, use the *Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report* plus independent research to answer the below questions.
#### 1. What is the difference between an incident and a breach?
``` 
An incident is a security event where confidentiality, integrity, and availability are compromised, 
whereas a breach is a confirmed data exposure by an unauthorized party.
```
#### 2. What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by outside actors? What percentage were perpetrated by internal actors? 
```
Breaches perpetrated by outside actors stood at around 80 percent, with internal actors at about 20 percent.
```
#### 3. What percentage of breaches were perpetrated by organized crime? 
```
Organized crime was responsible for 80 percent of breaches.
```
#### 4. What percentage of breaches were financially motivated? 
```
The majority of breaches were financially motivated, at over 90 percent.
```
#### 5. Define the following (Additional research may be required outside of the report): 
```
Denial of Service: 
The purpose of a DoS attack is to flood with traffic or by sending/requesting information. 
Some examples include buffer overflow, ICMP flooding, and SYN attacks. The results include 
slow server/services response to complete server/service crashes.
```
```
Command and Control: 
C2 is accomplished by infecting a workstation sitting behind a firewall. Usually, a hacker infects 
the workstation through phishing campaigns, browser plugins, etc.— once a hacker has 
control of the machine, they can download and execute malicious code. The device can, for example, 
become part of a botnet.
```
```
Backdoor:
A back door allows access to a device that bypasses the victim's usual safeguards and knowledge of said backdoor. 
Sometimes used for legitimate reasons, but more often than not is used as an exploit by threat actors.
```
```
Keylogger: 
A keylogger is a program that records a user's keystrokes and sends that information to a hacker. 
Its primary use is to gather credentials and other confidential information.
```
#### 6. What remains one of the most sought-after data types for hackers? 
```
Credentials are the most sought-after data for hackers.
```
#### 7. What was the percentage of breaches involving phishing?
```
Phishing accounts for 36 percent of breaches—a significant increase due to the pandemic.
```
