## Unit 11 Submission File: Network Security Homework 

### Part 1: Review Questions 

#### Security Control Types

The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set  of defense tactics.

1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?

> **Physical control**

2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?

> **Management Control**

3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?

> **Operational protection**

#### Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators

1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?

> **IDS (intrusion detection system) monitors network traffic, analyzes for known attacks and alerts to anything suspicous. IPS (intrusion prevention system), it does the same as IDS but with the difference that it stops traffic (rule bases) until its investigated.**

2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?

> **IoA indicates attacks happening in real time, focusing in detecting the intent of an attacker.
> While IoC focuses on attacks that have happened, mostly reactive only after exposure to a threat.**

#### The Cyber Kill Chain

Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.

1. Stage 1: 
> **Reconnaissance ->> Research and identification of target, email harvesting, port mapping, etc.**
2. Stage 2:
> **Weaponization ->> Embedding trojan with an exploit into a deliverable payload (e.g. PDF, DOCX, etc.)**
3. Stage 3:
> **Delivery ->> Delivering exploit to the target, through methods gathering in Stage 1 (Reconnaissance), e.g. email.**
4. Stage 4:
> **Exploitation ->> Exploiting vulnerable systems after the victim after delivery.**
5. Stage 5:
> **Installation ->> Backdoor install, allowing persistent access.**
6. Stage 6:
> **C&C ->> Outbound communication with an external server, providing "hands on keyboard" access to the target's network.**
7. Stage 7:
> **Actions on Objectives ->> With "hands on keyboard" access, the intruder can accomplish their original goals (e.g. data exfiltration, etc.)**

#### Snort Rule Analysis

Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:

Snort Rule #1

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

> **Alerts to all inbound [$EXTERNAL_NET] TCP traffic from ports 5800-5820.**

2. What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?

> **Stage 1: Reconnaissance ->> Research and identification of target, email harvesting, port mapping, etc.**

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

> **Indicator of attack by doing VNC scan**

Snort Rule #2

```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
```

1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.

> **Alerts to all inbound TCP HTTP traffic, port 80 for EXE or DLL files that are downloaded.** 

2. What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?

> **Policies, awareness and procedures.**

3. What kind of attack is indicated?

> **Potential payload delivery through download of EXE and DLL.**

Snort Rule #3

- Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the `msg` in the Rule Option.

> **```alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET 4444 -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ET TRAFFIC Potential Trojan & Crackdown Activity")```**

### Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab

#### Log into the Azure `firewalld` machine

Log in using the following credentials:

- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`

#### Uninstall `ufw`

Before getting started, you should verify that you do not have any instances of `ufw` running. This will avoid conflicts with your `firewalld` service. This also ensures that `firewalld` will be your default firewall.

- Run the command that removes any running instance of `ufw`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt remove ufw
    ```

#### Enable and start `firewalld`

By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:

- Run the commands that enable and start `firewalld` upon boots and reboots.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    $ sudo systemctl start firewalld
    ```

  Note: This will ensure that `firewalld` remains active after each reboot.

#### Confirm that the service is running.

- Run the command that checks whether or not the `firewalld` service is up and running.

    ```bash
    $ systemctl status firewalld
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --state
    ```


#### List all firewall rules currently configured.

Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.

- Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
    ```

- Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.

#### List all supported service types that can be enabled.

- Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
    ```

- We can see that the `Home` and `Drop` Zones are created by default.


#### Zone Views

- Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
    ```

- We can see that the `Public` and `Drop` Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for `Web`, `Sales`, and `Mail`.

#### Create Zones for `Web`, `Sales` and `Mail`.

- Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --new-zone=web --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --new-zone=sales --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --new-zone=mail --permanent
    ```

#### Set the zones to their designated interfaces:

- Run the commands that sets your `eth` interfaces to your zones.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --change-interface=eth1
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --change-interface=eth3
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --change-interface=eth2
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --change-interface=eth0
    ```

#### Add services to the active zones:

- Run the commands that add services to the **public** zone, the **web** zone, the **sales** zone, and the **mail** zone.

- Public:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=pop3
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=smtp
    ```

- Web:

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --add-service=http
    ```

- Sales

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --add-service=https
    ```

- Mail

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --add-service=pop3
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --add-service=smtp
    ```

- What is the status of `http`, `https`, `smtp` and `pop3`?

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=web
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=public
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=sales
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-services --zone=mail
    ```

#### Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.

- Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.

     ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-source=10.208.56.23 --permanent --zone=drop
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-source=135.95.103.76 --permanent --zone=drop
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --add-source=76.34.169.118 --permanent --zone=drop
    ```

#### Make rules permanent then reload them:

It's good practice to ensure that your `firewalld` installation remains nailed up and retains its services across reboots. This ensure that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as power failures.

- Run the command that reloads the `firewalld` configurations and writes it to memory

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

#### View active Zones

Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently **active** zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.

- Run the command that displays all zone services.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    ```


#### Block an IP address

- Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address `138.138.0.3`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='138.138.0.3' reject" --permanent 
    ```

#### Block Ping/ICMP Requests

Harden your network against `ping` scans by blocking `icmp echo` replies.

- Run the command that blocks `pings` and `icmp` requests in your `public` zone.

    ```bash
    sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-icmp-block={echo-reply,echo-request}
    ```

#### Rule Check

Now that you've set up your brand new `firewalld` installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.

- Run the command that lists all  of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.

    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=drop --list-all
    ```

- Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.


Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive `firewalld` installation.

### Part 3: IDS, IPS, DiD and Firewalls

Now, we will work on another lab. Before you start, complete the following review questions.

#### IDS vs. IPS Systems

1. Name and define two ways an IDS connects to a network.

> **NIDS (network intrusion detection system), perimeter, will passively examine all network traffic, sometimes placed in a DMZ.**

> **HIDS (host-based intrusion detection system), host, usually an agent is installed on the host machine and analyzes the entire system (file modifications, logs, etc.)**

2. Describe how an IPS connects to a network.

> **IPS will usually be placed between a firewall and a switch. Requires a high throughput device in order to analyze traffic at the full network speed.**

3. What type of IDS compares patterns of traffic to predefined signatures and is unable to detect Zero-Day attacks?

> **Signature type based IDS.**

4. Which type of IDS is beneficial for detecting all suspicious traffic that deviates from the well-known baseline and is excellent at detecting when an attacker probes or sweeps a network?

> **Anomaly type based IDS.**

#### Defense in Depth

1. For each of the following scenarios, provide the layer of Defense in Depth that applies:

    A) A criminal hacker tailgates an employee through an exterior door into a secured facility, explaining that they forgot their badge at home.

    > **Physical layer but also Policies, Procedures and Awareness, since the the criminal was allowed to tailgate.**

    B) A zero-day goes undetected by antivirus software.

    > **Application layer.**

    C) A criminal successfully gains access to HR’s database.

    > **Data layer.**

    D) A criminal hacker exploits a vulnerability within an operating system.

    > **Host layer.**

    E) A hacktivist organization successfully performs a DDoS attack, taking down a government website.

    > **Network layer.**

    F) Data is classified at the wrong classification level.

    > **Policies, Procedures and Awareness layer.**

    G) A state sponsored hacker group successfully firewalked an organization to produce a list of active services on an email server.

    > **Perimeter layer.**

2. Name one method of protecting data-at-rest from being readable on hard drive.

> **Symmetric hard drive encryption (e.g. Bitlocker).**

3. Name one method to protect data-in-transit.

> **HTTPS.**

4. What technology could provide law enforcement with the ability to track and recover a stolen laptop.

> **Usually through WiFi, GPS and monitoring agents that could be installed on the laptop (e.g. "Find My" from Apple)** 

5. How could you prevent an attacker from booting a stolen laptop using an external hard drive?

> **Disable USB booting devices at the BIOS level and set an Administrator password to access/modify the BIOS.**


#### Firewall Architectures and Methodologies

1. Which type of firewall verifies the three-way TCP handshake? TCP handshake checks are designed to ensure that session packets are from legitimate sources.

> **Circuit-level Gateway.**

2. Which type of firewall considers the connection as a whole? Meaning, instead of looking at only individual packets, these firewalls look at whole streams of packets at one time.

> **Stateful Firewall.**

3. Which type of firewall intercepts all traffic prior to being forwarded to its final destination. In a sense, these firewalls act on behalf of the recipient by ensuring the traffic is safe prior to forwarding it?

> **Application-level Gateway.**

4. Which type of firewall examines data within a packet as it progresses through a network interface by examining source and destination IP address, port number, and packet type- all without opening the packet to inspect its contents?

> **Packet Filtering.**

5. Which type of firewall filters based solely on source and destination MAC address?

>> **MAC layer Firewall.**



### Bonus Lab: "Green Eggs & SPAM"
In this activity, you will target spam, uncover its whereabouts, and attempt to discover the intent of the attacker.
 
- You will assume the role of a Jr. Security administrator working for the Department of Technology for the State of California.
 
- As a junior administrator, your primary role is to perform the initial triage of alert data: the initial investigation and analysis followed by an escalation of high priority alerts to senior incident handlers for further review.
 
- You will work as part of a Computer and Incident Response Team (CIRT), responsible for compiling **Threat Intelligence** as part of your incident report.

#### Threat Intelligence Card

**Note**: Log into the Security Onion VM and use the following **Indicator of Attack** to complete this portion of the homework. 

Locate the following Indicator of Attack in Sguil based off of the following:

- **Source IP/Port**: `188.124.9.56:80`
